Learning how to use wgpu and winit using [this tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/beginner/tutorial2-surface/#wait-what-s-going-on-with-renderpassdescriptor).
I have taken the libery of updating the dependencies to most recent versions and adjusting as needed.

I will be experimenting in this repository to learn these crates, as I will use them extensively in [BFTML](https://github.com/npetrangelo/BFTML).
